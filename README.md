## About me

After teaching maths for four years and combat sports for even more, I wanted a to become a learner again. I really enjoy trying to improve things, wether that be peoples' skills, recipes or whatever project I am working on. I have spent years trying to teach students to problem solve mathematically, which I loved and I believe has helped me have a better problem solving mindset. However, the times I have enjoyed most are when I have been the one working to solve the problems. Being a teacher really helped me appreciate working as a team towards a common goal and I was fortunate to have a great team to do this with. I am now looking forward to solving different problems with tech, which started with joining [Makers Academy](https://makers.tech/).

I think one of my strong points is being able to get a task done efficiently. I also believe I am a strong communicator and logical thinker. I would like to work at a company where I can use these skills to create software that solves problems and I can continue learning whilst there.

## Skills

#### Excellent communicator and presenter ####
Finding ways of presenting and communicating complex ideas and making them understandable was the main part of my role as a teacher. I honed my teaching and knowledge sharing skills by making sure my lessons were always pitched at the right level and broken down into manageable chunks for the students. I worked within a team where collaboration and communication was highly valued and this was an aspect of my job that I thoroughly enjoyed.

#### Efficiency and ability to learn quickly ####
I have always been a fast learner. I competed in my first Brazilian jiu-jitsu tournament when I was 17 after only 4 weeks of training, achieving a bronze medal. Being able to learn fast alongside my efficiency enables me to complete tasks and projects quickly.


#### Empathy and teamwork ####
Post covid, I co ran our colleges catch up scheme. A colleage and I created the programme where students mentored each other and some also recieved extra tuition from me. The scheme was aimed at helping student who really struggled during the periods when the college was closed due to the pandemic. The programme was massively over subscribed as the students found it so helpful. I also have lots of experience helping, coaching and cornering my team mates when I trained and competed in varous combat sports.

## Hobbies

I really enjoy being active as it helps me think clearly and feel great. Over the past ten years I have been heavily involved in combat sports. I have fought up to a semi-professional level in muay thai and competed in several Brazillian Jiu Jitsu tournaments. I have also coached, and even cornered fighters up to a professional level. I've recently started indoor rock climbing as a new challenge. I also love going to gigs and cooking, especially gradually improving a recipe over time until it's as good as I can make it. It's safe to say over the lockdowns I ate a lot of homemade pizza, but I think I make a good one now.
