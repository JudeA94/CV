## Jude Ashworth

After teaching maths for four years and combat sports for even more, I wanted a to become a learner again. I really enjoy trying to improve things, wether that be peoples' skills, recipes or whatever project I am working on. I have spent years trying to teach students to problem solve mathematically, which I loved and I believe have helped me have a better problem solving mindset. However, the times I have enjoyed most are when I have been the one working to solve the problems. Working as a teacher really helped me appreciate working as a team to work towards a common goal and I was fortunate to have a great team to do this with. I am now looking for different problems to solve in the world of tech, which started when joining Makers Academy.

## Skills

Consider skills relevant to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

-How was the skill used?

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result?


#### This Skill

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence (STAR)

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed (again use STAR for this)

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Education

#### Makers Academy (October 22 to February 23)
A 16-week intensive development bootcamp, where I have  :
- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problem solve efficiently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below: 
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### University of Bristol (September 12 to June 16)

- MSci in Mathematics 2:1

#### University College London (September 17 to June 18)

- Post graduate certificate in education (PGCE) in mathematics

#### Any other qualifications

That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person

## Hobbies

I really enjoy being active as it helps me think clearly feel great. Whilst at university I ran the muay thai club, teaching classes and organising fight nights. I also fought at an amateur level in my first two years and semi professionally in my third year. Continually training and improving my skillset allowed me to get experience working as an assistant coach, in both muay thai and boxing, in various gyms both in Bristol and London. I eventually also became the striking coach for a small mixed martial arts club, even cornering and helping a fighter at the professional level. I've recently started indoor rock climbing for a new challenge. I also love going to gigs and cooking, especially gradually improving a recipe over time until it's as good as I can make it. It's safe to say over the lockdowns I ate a lot of homemade pizza, but I think I make a good one now.
