## Jude Ashworth

After teaching maths for four years and combat sports for even more, I wanted a to become a learner again. I really enjoy trying to improve things, wether that be peoples' skills, recipes or whatever project I am working on. I have spent years trying to teach students to problem solve mathematically, which I loved and I believe has helped me have a better problem solving mindset. However, the times I have enjoyed most are when I have been the one working to solve the problems. Being a teacher really helped me appreciate working as a team towards a common goal and I was fortunate to have a great team to do this with. I am now looking forward to solving different problems with tech, which started with joining Makers Academy.

## Skills

Consider skills relevant to software development. Then consider your best skills. Pick 2-4 skills and write a short descriptive paragraph for each one. You should demonstrate how capable you are at this skill with examples.
(Using a STAR example Paragraph) Consider the questions below.

-STAR
-What was the situation/task? (ST)

-How was the skill used?

-What did you do? (action)

-What was the result?


#### This Skill

- Experience
- Achievements
- Evidence (STAR)

#### Another Skill

Descriptive paragraph of how capable you are at this skill and, if relevant, how it has developed (again use STAR for this)

- I achieved A during my work at B (job, or otherwise)
- I contributed to the growth of X while doing Y (job, or otherwise)
- I built this, made this, broke this, fixed this, etc.
- A link to some on-line evidence (blogs, videos, articles, etc.)

## Education

#### Makers Academy (Oct 2022 to Feb 2023)
A 16-week intensive development bootcamp, where I have  :
- Use short descriptions of what you did and a skill you used. (Similar to format from the 'Work Experience' section above)
- e.g Frequently used paring in order to problem solve efficiently, requiring teamwork and communication.
- you might also mention aspects some other skills/knowledge listed below: 
- OOP, TDD, MVC, DDD
- Agile/XP
- Ruby, Rails, JavaScript
- RSpec, Jasmine

#### University of Bristol (Sept 2012 to June 2016)

- MSci in Mathematics 2:1

#### University College London (Sept 2017 to June 2018)

- Post graduate certificate in education (PGCE) in mathematics

#### Any other qualifications

That in some arguable way make you a better software developer or well-rounded person

## Hobbies

I really enjoy being active as it helps me think clearly and feel great. Over the past ten years I have been heavily involved in combat sports. I have fought up to a semi-professional level in muay thai and competed in several Brazillian Jiu Jitsu tournaments. I have also coached, and even cornered fighters up to a professional level. I've recently started indoor rock climbing as a new challenge. I also love going to gigs and cooking, especially gradually improving a recipe over time until it's as good as I can make it. It's safe to say over the lockdowns I ate a lot of homemade pizza, but I think I make a good one now.
